        <p style="color: navy;">Foundation Story
            Founded by three partners of French origin in 1988, LUKU EMPIRE started its commercial life as a wholesale brand. Established and registered in Paris, LUKU EMPIRE attracted attention with its t-shirt and sweatshirt designs in the first place. With the separation of the two founding partners of the brand in time, LUKU EMPIRE was passed to George Amouyal as the sole shareholder. Tema Tekstil, which is connected to Taha Group and is the producer as well as licensor of LUKU EMPIRE in Kenya, bought the worldwide rights of the LUKU EMPIRE brand in 1997.</p>
